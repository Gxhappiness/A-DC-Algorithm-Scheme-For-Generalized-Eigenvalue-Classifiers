# A-DC-Algorithm-Scheme-For-Generalized-Eigenvalue-Classifiers
 the major disadvantages of generalized eigenvalue based method lie in that they may be time-consuming and fail to get a stable or optimal solution due to the matrix singularity. This paper proposes a new method using a DC Algorithm scheme to solve a fractional optimization models which ensure the optimality of the solution.
